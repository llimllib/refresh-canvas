  //get a reference to the canvas

  ctx.arc(75, 75, 10, 0, Math.PI*2, true); 
  ctx.closePath();

  The first thing we need to do is create an instance of the &lt;canvas&gt; element so that
     we can start to draw on it. If you look in the source for this page, you'll see a 
     declaration that looks like this:<br />
     <pre>&lt;canvas id="canvas" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
     This declaration creates the canvas on which we'll draw in the rest of the tutorial.
     <p>Now that we've got a canvas to draw on, let's do so:

  You may want to comment out the <code>arc(...)</code> call and try
      <code>ctx.rect(x, y, width, height)</code>.
      <p>Make sure you keep the arc and rect calls in between calls to
      <code>beginPath()</code> and <code>closePath()</code> just like the
      sample call above. You may also try substituting <code>stroke()</code>
      for <code>fill()</code>.
